        <p class="">At TrainForCyber, accessible from https://TrainForCyber.org, one of our main
            priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains
            types of information that is collected and recorded by TrainForCyber and how we use
            it.</p>
        
        <p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy
            Policy, do not hesitate to&nbsp;<a href="https://TrainForCyber.net/contact/">contact
                us</a>.</p>
      
        <p  class="py-3 md:text-xl"><strong>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</strong></p>
        
        <p class="py-3 md:text-xl"><strong>Comments/Contact Form</strong></p>
        
        <p>When visitors leave comments on the site or contact us with the contact form we
            collect the data shown in the comments/contact form, and also the visitor’s IP
            address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
        
        <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be
            provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service
            privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of
            your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your
            comment.</p>
        
        <p  class="py-3 md:text-xl"><strong>Media</strong></p>
        
        <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded
            location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract
            any location data from images on the website.</p>
        
        <p class="py-3 md:text-xl"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
       
        <p>Like any other website, TrainForCyber uses ‘cookies. We use cookies to help us
            remember and process the items in your shopping cart and understand and save your
            preferences for future visits. These cookies are used to store information including
            visitors’ preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or
            visited. The information is used to optimize the users’ experience by customizing
            our web page content based on visitors’ browser type and/or other information.</p>
       
        <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address,
            and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to
            fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last
            for one year.</p>
    
        <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your
            browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when
            you close your browser.</p>
  
        <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information
            and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options
            cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for
            two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
   
        <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your
            browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of
            the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
    
        <p class="py-3 md:text-xl"><strong>Embedded content from other websites</strong></p>
      
        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles,
            etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the
            visitor has visited the other website.</p>
   
        <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party
            tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including
            tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are
            logged in to that website.</p>

        <p  class="py-3 md:text-xl"><strong>How long we retain your data</strong></p>
   
        <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This
            is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of
            holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
 
        <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal
            information they provide in their user profiles. All users can see, edit, or delete
            their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username).

        <p>If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can request to receive
            an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have
            provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about
            you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative,
            legal, or security purposes.</p>
